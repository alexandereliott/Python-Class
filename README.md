#Automated phiser.

I wrote a slightly more secure phising python script that was based off of Twilio's docs.

The main differences are that I have the variables in a separate file which gets imported by the script.

The script will send out a poorly written phising text message which will tell the target that their device has a virus and that to fix it the target has to install a vpn so the phiser can fix it.
